                <h2>I design for humans to help brands grow</h2>
                <p>Some of the companies I‚Äôve worked with have been backed by YC, Techstarts, Seedcamp, Founders Factory and other top
                startup accelerators and VCs. My work has been featured on The Next Web, TechCrunch, Awwwards, Wired and other leading
                media outlets, thanks to which you‚Äôre now reading this.</p>

            <div class="about-mywork">
                <p>As a freelance Web Developer, I‚Äôve been exposed to hundreds of projects over the years acting as a lead designer,
                UX lead, UX consultant and product advisor, which have helped me to optimise the quality and speed of my design work. I
                always work with a clear timeframe towards specific deliverables and outcomes, so even though design is a creative
                process, it‚Äôs always aligned with the business objectives.</p>
                <p>I approach all my projects, regardless of the project size, with a kick-off discovery session to understand my client‚Äôs
                vision, the business objectives and what the user data is indicating. I‚Äôve trained myself to make a quick usability test
                the moment I open a new website or an app, so this comes almost for free during our first meeting.</p>
                <p>I help companies to build and launch their products, improve their UX and product performance or completely re-brand
                their identity.</p>

                    Stef was recommended to me by two different contacts so I was lucky enough not to have to go through other channels to
                    find a suitable designer ... we were able to work well together to bring a key part of our platform to life in a very
                    short timeframe. I would highly recommend his services to anybody that requires some fresh thinking on their projects. <br>

                    Stef recently redesigned the UX for a complex two-sided platform for us and did a fantastic job. The project
                    required
                    the ability to synthesise a large number of data variables into an easy to navigate system for our users, and he
                    achieved this really well. Stef is also fast, responsive and really listened to our needs as a client - highly
                    recommended! <br>

                    I genuinely love working with Stef. He has been key to building our brand and visual identify. We've challenged him
                    across the full gamut of design, from screen to print, desktop to mobile, and the results are always on point. I'd
                    work
                    with him again in a moment. <br>
